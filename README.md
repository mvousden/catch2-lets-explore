About
---

Welcome to "let's explore Catch2", which includes a simple Catch2 example for
testing C++. Catch2 is a testing framework for C++, and lives at
https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2. This example assumes that you have shell
familiarity.

Cloning
---

This repository contains Catch2 as a submodule (you will need to `git clone
--recursive`).

Environment
---

You will need (I use):

 - gcc (8.2.1), but really any C++ compiler will work. You'll need to edit the
   build scripts appropriately though.

 - Shell (4.4)
